    <CustomButtons>
        <!--
        Describes all custom buttons used in <Button> in <Kits>.
        Attributes:
            ID. The unique identifier of the button. System buttons have ids >= 0, custom buttons
                have < 0 ids.
            NAME. [Optional] The visible name of the button.
                  If the attribute is not specified, then the value equals to TEXT attribute.
            TEXT. [Optional] The text that is appended to input text field after the button is pressed.
                  If the attribute is not specified, then the value equals to NAME attribute.
                  At least NAME or TEXT attribute must be specified.
            TYPE. The type of the button:
                   - EQUALS. Indicate that after pressing this button the expression must be calculated.
                   - DIGIT. Indicate that this button is a digit or symbol which behavior equals to
                            digit behavior (e.g. point)
                   - BASE. Indicate that this button's appearance must equal to DIGIT appearance but
                           not it's behavior.
                   - SYMBOL. Indicates secondary operation
                             (e.g. abs, pow or plus, multiplication (although they are not))
                   - SHIFT. This button case-inverses all other buttons in the Page with
                            ENABLE_CASE_INVERSE flag.
                   - SYSTEM. This button toggles system properties. Property name is written in
                             "name" field.
                             - "amu". Toggles measurement units of angle (rad/deg).
            LOCALE_EAST. Explanation requires an example. In western literature tangent's abbreviation
                         is tan, while in eastern - tg. So this attribute specifies id of a button
                         that should be used instead if the locale is eastern.
            ENABLE_CASE_INVERSE. Indicates that text of this button can be case-inversed (i.e. to
                                 upper or lower case).
        -->
        <!-- In this example a button with localeEast presented. Actually, custom buttons cannot have this
             attribute (system buttons only). No exception will be thrown reading this document, however,
             in Edit Keyboard Kits both buttons will be shown. -->
        <Button id="-1" name="Hello, World!" text="Western locale!" type="symbol" localeEast="-2" enableCaseInverse="true"/>
        <Button id="-2" name="Hello, World!" text="Eastern locale!" type="symbol" enableCaseInverse="true"/>
